# Fitness App - README

## Project Overview
This project is a fitness application built with **Django** and utilizes various **AWS services** like **S3**, **SNS**, **DynamoDB**, **CloudWatch**, and CI/CD with **GitHub Actions**. It allows users to upload workout plans, recipes, and track their fitness journey with real-time notifications, optimized image storage, and performance monitoring.

---

## Dependencies

Below is a list of required dependencies for this fitness app:

### Python Dependencies:
1. **Django**: The web framework used to build the application.
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

2. **boto3**: AWS SDK for Python to interact with AWS services like S3, SNS, SQS, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch.
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

3. **djangorestframework**: For building RESTful APIs to manage the app's data.
   ```bash
   pip install djangorestframework
   ```

4. **django-storages**: Used for managing file storage with S3.
   ```bash
   pip install django-storages
   ```

5. **celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks, used alongside SQS for background operations.
   ```bash
   pip install celery
   ```

6. **gunicorn**: WSGI server to run the Django app in production.
   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   ```

7. **python-dotenv**: To manage environment variables, especially for storing sensitive credentials.
   ```bash
   pip install python-dotenv
   ```

8. **jmespath**: Required by AWS CLI (in case needed for configuring AWS services).
   ```bash
   pip install jmespath
   ```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fitness-app.git
cd fitness-app
```

### 2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**

To avoid conflicts with other packages, itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**

Install all the required Python dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` yet, you can create one using:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### 4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project to store environment variables like your AWS credentials, Django settings, and any sensitive information:

```text
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1,your_domain.com
```

### 5. **Configure Django Settings**

In `settings.py`, make sure you configure the AWS and storage settings:

- **S3 Storage**:
  ```python
  DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.s3boto3.S3Boto3Storage'
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.getenv('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.getenv('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
  AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = os.getenv('AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME')
  AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'us-east-1'  # or your region
  AWS_S3_FILE_OVERWRITE = False
  AWS_DEFAULT_ACL = None
  ```

- **SNS Notifications** (Make sure to replace the `AWS_SNS_TOPIC_ARN` in your Django code or views when you send notifications):
  ```python
  import boto3
  sns = boto3.client('sns', region_name='us-east-1')
  ```

- **SQS Queue**:
  ```python
  import boto3
  sqs = boto3.client('sqs', region_name='us-east-1')
  ```

### 6. **Migrate the Database**

Run the following Django commands to set up the database:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. **Create a Superuser**

To access the Django admin panel, create a superuser:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. **Set Up Elastic Beanstalk**

- **Install AWS CLI and EB CLI** (if not done already):
  - [Install AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
  - [Install EB CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html)

### 2. **Configure EB CLI**

If you're deploying to Elastic Beanstalk, run:

```bash
eb init
```

- Follow the prompts to set up the Elastic Beanstalk environment.
- Choose the appropriate region and application name.
- Select the platform (e.g., `Python`).

### 3. **Create an Elastic Beanstalk Environment**

```bash
eb create fitness-app-env
```

### 4. **Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk**

```bash
eb deploy
```

### 5. **Configure Environment Variables in Elastic Beanstalk**

In the AWS Management Console, navigate to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, then go to **Configuration > Software**. Add the following environment variables:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME`
- `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`

### 6. **Access the Application**

After deployment, you can access the application using the URL provided by Elastic Beanstalk (e.g., `http://your-app-name.elasticbeanstalk.com`).

## Monitoring and Logs

### 1. **CloudWatch for Logs and Monitoring**
Ensure that **CloudWatch** is configured in the AWS console to monitor your app's health, performance, and logs. You can check application logs via the AWS console.

---

## CI/CD Setup (GitHub Actions)

To set up continuous integration and deployment with **GitHub Actions**:

1. Create a `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
name: Django CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run migrations
      run: python manage.py migrate
    - name: Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk
      env:
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
      run: |
        eb init -p python-3.x fitness-app --region us-east-1
        eb deploy
```

2. Add your **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** and **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY** to GitHub Secrets under your repository's **Settings > Secrets**.

3. The workflow will automatically deploy the app to Elastic Beanstalk whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
